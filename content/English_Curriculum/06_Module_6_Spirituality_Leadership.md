## 6.1 The Heart of the Blower

**"God requires the heart." (Mishnah)**

*   **Kavanah (Intention)**: Blowing the Shofar is not a musical performance; it is a prayer without words.
*   **Preparation**: Before blowing, take a moment to repent (Teshuvah) and align your heart with God. If your heart is angry or distracted, the sound will reflect it.

### Prayer Before Blowing
> "May it be Your will that the sound of this Shofar pierce the heavens and awaken the hearts of Your people to return to You in love."

## 6.2 Leadership (Ba'al Tekiah)

The **Ba'al Tekiah** (Master of the Blast) is the leader of the service.

### Responsibilities
1.  **Competence**: Must be flawless in technique so the congregation is not distracted by mistakes.
2.  **Humility**: Must not show off. You are a conduit, not the source.
3.  **Knowledge**: Must know the Halacha (laws) of Shofar blowing perfectly.
