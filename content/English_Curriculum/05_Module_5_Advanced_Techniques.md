## 5.1 Advanced Tone Control

### Dynamics (Volume)
*   **Crescendo/Decrescendo**: Practice starting from a whisper (piano) and swelling to a roar (forte), and back.
*   **Breath Support**: Volume comes from *air speed*, not just lip tension.

### Pitch Bending
*   The Shofar usually has 2-3 natural notes.
*   **Lip Slurs**: Practice moving smoothly between the low and high notes without breaking the sound.
*   **Correction**: If your pitch is flat, tighten your corners. If sharp, relax slightly.

## 5.2 Endurance Training

*   **Muscle Building**: The "Pencil Exercise" (holding a pencil with lips only) builds corner muscles.
*   **Rest Periods**: For every minute of playing, rest for a minute.
*   **Long Tones**: The key to endurance. Aim for a 20-second steady Tekiah.

## 5.3 Ensemble Playing (The 120)

When playing with 120 energetic blowers (like Gideon's army or the Temple Levites):

1.  **Synchronization**: Watch the conductor or the "Ba'al Tekiah" (Leader). Do not start or stop on your own.
2.  **Tuning**: Since Shofars are natural horns, they are rarely perfectly in tune.
    *   **Solution**: Focus on the *rhythm* and *timbre* rather than perfect pitch harmony. The dissonance creates the "shattering" effect.
3.  **Roles**:
    *   **Base**: Low Rams' horns providing the drone.
    *   **Tenor**: Yemenite horns playing the melody/calls.
    *   **Soprano**: Smaller Rams' horns for high accents.

---

## 5.4 Rehearsal Etiquette

*   **Warm-up**: Always warm up individually before the group start.
*   **Silence**: When the conductor speaks, 120 horns must be silent.
*   **Eye Contact**: Keep eyes on the leader, not just the floor.
