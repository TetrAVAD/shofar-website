## 2.1 Materials: What is it made of?

The Shofar must be made from the horn of a kosher animal (chews cud and has split hooves).

### Permitted Animals
*   **Ram (Male Sheep)**: The most traditional, recalling the Binding of Isaac.
*   **Kudu (Antelope)**: Yemenite Jews traditionally use this long, spiraled horn.
*   **Goat / Gazelle**: Permissible but less common.

### Forbidden Materials
*   **Cow/Calf**: Forbidden because it reminds of the "Golden Calf" sin.
*   **Non-animal materials**: Plastic or metal horns are not kosher Shofars.

## 2.2 Structure of the Horn

*   **Keratin**: The horn is made of keratin (like fingernails), growing over a bony core.
*   **The Cartilage**: The bone must be removed during processing.
*   **The Shape**: It is naturally curved. A Shofar explicitly "straightened" is acceptable, but usually, the natural curve is preferred to symbolize a "bowed heart" (humility).

## 2.3 Types of Shofars

1.  **Ashkenazi Shofar (Ram's Horn)**
    *   Short, simple curve.
    *   Sound: Piercing, high-pitched, crying sound.
    *   Common in European traditions.
2.  **Yemenite Shofar (Kudu)**
    *   Long, multiple spirals.
    *   Sound: Deep, resonant, booming.
    *   Often preferred for musicality.
3.  **Moroccan Shofar**
    *   Flat and polished, usually from a Ram.

## 2.4 Choosing Your Shofar (Selection Guide)

**"The Shofar chooses the blower."**

1.  **Mouthpiece**: The most critical part. It should fit your lips comfortably.
    *   *Check*: Is the edge smooth? Is the hole too small or too big?
2.  **Sound Check**:
    *   Can you produce a sound easily?
    *   Does it have a clear low tone and a clear high tone?
3.  **Smell**:
    *   Improperly cured horns smell terrible. Ensure it is fully cleaned.

## 2.5 Maintenance Basics

*   **Moisture**: Keep it dry after use.
*   **Smell Removal**: Use specialized sprays or baking soda (do not soak for too long).
*   **Cracks**: Minor cracks can be sealed, but major cracks affecting the sound may render it non-kosher.
