### 2. Shevarim (שְׁבָרִים) - "The Broken Ones"

### 3. Teruah (תְּרוּעָה) - "The Alarm"

## 4.2 The Rosh Hashanah Sequence

On Rosh Hashanah, we blow 100 blasts in specific sets:

1.  **Tashrat (תשר״ת)**: Tekiah - Shevarim - Teruah - Tekiah
2.  **Tashat (תש״ת)**: Tekiah - Shevarim - Tekiah
3.  **tarat (תר״ת)**: Tekiah - Teruah - Tekiah

You must memorize these sequences (Seder Tekiot).

## 4.3 The Role of the Caller (Makri)

*   Since the blower is focused on the sound, a "Makri" (Caller) stands next to him and calls out the next sound to ensure no mistakes are made.
