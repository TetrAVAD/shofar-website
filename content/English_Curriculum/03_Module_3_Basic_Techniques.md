## 3.1 Physics of the Shofar

Unlike a trumpet, a Shofar has **no valves**. All pitch changes are controlled by your **lips** (embouchure) and **air speed**.
*   **Acoustics**: It acts as a conical bore amplifier. The shorter the horn, the higher the pitch generally.

## 3.2 Breathing Technique

**"Low and Slow."**

1.  **Diaphragmatic Breathing**:
    *   Do not raise your shoulders.
    *   Expand your belly and lower back like a balloon.
2.  **Support**:
    *   Engage your core muscles to create steady air pressure (compression).
    *   This is the "engine" of your sound.

## 3.3 The Embouchure (Lip Formation)

1.  **Placement**:
    *   Side vs. Center: Traditionally, the Shofar is blown from the **right side** of the mouth (to let the words of prayer come from the center). However, center is also acceptable if needed.
2.  **The Buzz**:
    *   Tighten the corners of your mouth.
    *   Vibrate the center of your lips (like spitting a seed).
    *   **Tip**: Practice buzzing *without* the Shofar first.

## 3.4 Producing Your First Sound

1.  Place the mouthpiece firmly against your lips (seal the air).
2.  Inhale deeply.
3.  Blow the "Buzz" into the small hole.
4.  **Troubleshooting**:
    *   *Air hissing?* -> Press harder or tighten lips.
    *   *No sound?* -> The hole might be blocked by your lip. Open your aperture slightly.

## 3.5 Practice Routine (Week 1)

*   **Long Tones**: Hold a steady note for 5-10 seconds.
*   **Articulations**: Practice stating notes with "Tah" or "Too."
*   **Rest**: Rest as much as you play to avoid lip fatigue.
